            </h2>
            <p>
              Our application collects the minimum necessary information to
              provide the following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Use without login</strong>: You can upload images, which
                will be automatically deleted after 3 days. We also offer a
                feature to convert Markdown to PDF. The conversion is done on
                the server, but the data is not saved and is immediately
                discarded.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use with login</strong>: You can upload images, which
                will be automatically deleted after half a year. You can save up
                to 10 Markdown documents on the server. The PDF conversion
                feature is the same as when not logged in.
